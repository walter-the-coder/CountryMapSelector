CountryMapSelector
==================

 Autocomplete input field connected to a map who highlight selected country. Made with AngularJS

 This widget works this way: 1 input field with a list of all contry names attached to it so that and country search is autocompleatable. A canvas with a cutout of the world map scrolls to the selected country and lights it up. (all unselected countries are just white with black borders)
 As of 2nd May 2014, this widget is not finished yet. I have basically made this as a show for a future employer but feel free to help me continue develop this into a nice and fast learning/ selection tool.
